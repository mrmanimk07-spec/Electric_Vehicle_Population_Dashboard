Analyzing Electric Vehicle Adoption Trends and Performance Across Regions
1. Project Overview:
The Electric Vehicle Population Analysis project aims to explore trends and insights from statewide electric vehicle registration data. The dataset contains detailed information about EV models, manufacturers, electric range, MSRP, geographic distribution (city, county, census tract), and eligibility for clean vehicle incentives.
Objective:
The main objective is Analyze EV Adoption Trends, Understand Geographic Distribution, Evaluate Market Characteristics, Assess Environmental & Policy Impact, Build Interactive Dashboards.

3. Problem Statement:
      1. Analyze overall electric vehicle (EV) adoption across different regions using the dataset.
     2. Identify trends in EV growth by model year to understand how adoption has changed over time.
     3. Compare EV manufacturers to determine which makes and models are most widely used.
     4. Evaluate electric range performance across vehicles to understand capability differences between BEVs and PHEVs.
    5. Identify geographic hotspots (cities, counties, ZIP codes) where EV adoption is highest.
   6. Determine the distribution of vehicle types (BEV vs PHEV) across regions.
   7. Examine CAFV eligibility trends to see how many vehicles qualify for clean fuel programs.
   8. Provide insights to support EV infrastructure planning, such as charging station expansion in high-adoption areas.
   9. Create interactive visualizations and filters to allow decision-makers to explore EV characteristics by location, model year, make, vehicle type, and electric range.
